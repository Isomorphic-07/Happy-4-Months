                    <h3>Dear my Pretty Qui,</h3>
                    <p> I hope you like this website I made hahaha. Wanted to try something new so I put myself
                        to the challenge of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch today (20th Jan 2025) and
                        complete a semi-functioning website for our 4 month anniversary. Since you're in SF, I am sorry
                        I can't be there in person to give you a gift, but I hope this website here makes up for it. There
                        are a few easter eggs here and there so play around with the website, you might find something cool!
                        This website here is the beginning of something great that I have planned, who knows, maybe it will be
                        useful, maybe not, but I've learnt alot from self-teaching myself web-design. 

                    </p>
                    <p> Btw, let me explain what each of the languages do and why 3 languages are needed for website building:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML: Used for text writing, i.e I am writing this e-letter to you on HTML rn!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CSS: Used for styling, all the pretty colors and formating that you see, thats CSS
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript: JS Daddy is used for animations and adding queries/event listeners (I'm still very novice at this bby, so still learning)
                        Once I become an expert at this I can provide a better explanation lol.
                    </p>

                    <p> Any who, lets get back to why I made this in the first place, I've been so excited to
                        tell you. I'm making this website for when you want to launch your business!!! I believe in 
                        you so much (I don't even know what you'll be doing) and I want to be part of your business too. I'm still learning (I'm an
                        electrical engineering and maths student trying to build a fancy, aesthetically pleasing
                        website, doesn't make sense lol), but I want to learn this to build projects and ofcourse
                        to help you so that you don't have to use weird non-coding website makers like WIX or GoDaddy or those other ones.
                    </p>
                    <p> I still have a long way to go bby, I made this in essentially 2 days, from scratch and all, so I know maybe right now
                        it doesn't look the best, but with time, you won't notice that I'm actually not a professional web dev lmao. Anyways, 
                        HAPPY 4 MONTH ANNIVERSARY my loveeeee. Can't believe its been 4 months since I asked you to be my first and last gf in Sydney at 11pm lol.
                        We have grown so much together and its only the beginning of the year!! We are going to get stronger, smarter and better. We will
                        get closer to achieving our goals this year. One month closer to marriage bby. I love you more than you can imagine. HAHAHA I hope you
                        like this website, this is just the beginning of something greater. GREAT THINGS COMING SOON. Watch this space!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>From your one and only,</p>
